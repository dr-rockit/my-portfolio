This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ğŸš€ Locked 3D Library Versions

This project uses specific versions of the 3D rendering libraries to avoid known issues:

- `three@0.160.1`: Avoids removal of `LuminanceFormat` and introduction of `BatchedMesh`
- `@react-three/fiber@9.1.2`: Compatible with Three >= 0.156
- `@react-three/drei@10.0.6`: Requires Three >= 0.159

These versions are locked to ensure a stable development experience. Do not update without testing against `three-stdlib` or other dependent packages.
